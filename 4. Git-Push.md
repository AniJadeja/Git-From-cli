# Git Push

To push to the remote repository, you will need to have a remote repository in the github account.
It is assumed that previous steps have been followed and the user is logged in in the github cli.


1. issue the following command to the terminal to create a remote repository.
   ```
   gh repo create <repo_name> --<flags>
   ```

   repo name and flags should be modified according to the need. 
   There are two flags to create a repo. `private` and `public`.

   so the command would look like this.

   ```
   gh repo create xyzRepo --private
   ```
   OR
   ```
   gh repo create xyzRepo --public
   ```

2. Now the repo is created on github, you need to add the origin remote to your local git.
