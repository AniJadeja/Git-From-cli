#Git custom commands

custom commands helps us to solve problems of writing full lenghy commands.
It can be used when you repeatedly use lengthy commands. 

For me one scenario is, I want to push the code to current branch.
I typically need to write, 
```
git push origin <branchName>
```
Now it is possible that I have a long branchname. 
For example, `feature/system-users-login` or `issue/21-system-users-login`
